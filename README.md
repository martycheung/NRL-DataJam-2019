# NRL-DataJam-2019
Rugby League Sports Analytics Hackathon 2019
The Accenture team made up of Chris Byrne, Joe Cleaves, Greg Johnstone and I entered the NRL DataJam in Nov 2019. The data (confidential) consisted of play-by-play game data and GPS data of all players on the field. 

Our chosen problem to was "When a team is awarded a penalty, should they kick for goal (2pts) or should they continue to attack for a try (4pts)". Our solution involved building a model which evaluated the expected points in each section of the attacking half of the field, according to the points differential, possession, momentum, historical kicking accuracy, game stage and many other factors. 

We presented results in a Tableau dashboard, which would allow coaches and analysts to input what-if game scenarios or real-time in-game stats to make their decision. Our team was awarded 3rd prize at the end of the Hackathon.
